    <i>MathDoku</i> is a variant of Sudoku.
    Rows and cloumns contain unique values, respectively.
    But instead of the 3&times;3 sub-grids, there are sections that fulfil a mathematical equation.
    For example, a region that is tagged as "15+" needs to add up to 15.
    Likewise, "7/" means that one of the values in the region, divided by 7, results in the other value.
    The "-" and "/" operators only show for regions of two cells, "+" and "*" can have more cells.
</p>

<p>
    You can activate a "maybe mode", where you can set possible values for a cell.
    If a cell in the same row or column is set, the respective possible values will be automatically cleared.
    You can adjust the game size from 4&times;4 to 9&times;9, and the difficulty from 1-5.
    A timer will run in the background.
    Why not start with a <router-link :to="'/new/4'">new game</router-link>?

<p>
    This is a "progressive web app" primarily designed for mobile.
    That means you can "install" the game as an app on your phone.
    On Android, open this page in Chrome mobile, then select "Install app" from the â‹® menu.
